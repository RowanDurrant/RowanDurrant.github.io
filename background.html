<h1>Background</h1>

<h2>2016 - 2019: BSc in Genetics at Swansea University</h2>
<p>During my A-levels I had developed an interest in epigenetics, so wanted to study genetics at degree level. During the course I realised that I wasn't cut out for lab work,
but was very interested in learning to program with R. I had the opportunity to develop my R skills during my third year project, where I created my first epidemiological 
model: a very simple SI model that simulated an outbreak of scrapie in a sheep flock. This model included inheritance of PRNP alleles that could confer differing levels 
of protection against scrapie, and I used estimates of PRNP allele frequencies in different sheep breeds from the literature to assess how different herds of sheep would 
be affected in an outbreak. This work remains unpublished. </p> <img src="/RowanDurrant.github.io/assets/Picture1.png" alt="Graph of how mortality varies by sheep breed">

<h2>2019 - 2020: MRes in Biosciences at Swansea University</h2>
<p>As I wanted to continue in epidemiological modelling as a career, I chose to switch from the medical school to the biosciences department at Swansea from my masters as I knew it 
had a biomaths group. Luckily one of the research projects available that year was to create a metapopulation model of devil facial tumour disease. During this project I adapted 
an existing individual-based model of DFTD into a metapopulation model, which involved creating the metapopulation network structure from scratch. I initially attempted to use a 
species distribution model with Tasmanian devil sighting data from <a href = "https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a> to determine where devils inhabited the island of Tasmania and to create patches based on predicted presence,
 but due to biases in sightings data I eventually settled on using <a href = "https://www.thelist.tas.gov.au/app/content/data/geo-meta-data-record?detailRecordUID=99de4ddb-d9c3-430b-ad29-055b80cc46ec">the TASVEG vegetation maps</a> 
 to find continuous areas of the devils' preferred 
habitat. I then disrupted this network to measure the impact of fragmentation on the spread of DFTD and the survival and genetic diversity of the Tasmanian devils. This work 
has been published and can be read here: <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/10/12/1592">Disruption of Metapopulation Structure Reduces Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour 
 Disease Spread at the Expense of Abundance and Genetic Diversity</a></p> <img src="/RowanDurrant.github.io/pathogens-10-01592-g001.png" alt="Map of Tasmanian devil habitat and the resulting network">
