<h2>My Research</h2>
<p>I currently work at the intersection of outbreak modelling and viral evolution and genomics. I have developed a simulation framework
    that combines a pre-existing epidemiological model of rabies with an evolutionary model that allows me to generate synthetic genetic
    data similar to the data that my colleagues produce in the field. Using this framework I can explore questions regarding rabies 
    evolution at different timescales, evaluate the tools we apply to genomic data and develop new methods.

<h3>Exploring how rabies evolves within the host</h3>
<p>The first chapter of my PhD thesis (available as a preprint <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.04.556169v1">here!</a>) 
    uses this simulation framework to investigate whether 
    some of the issues we have with phylogenetic analysis with rabies could be due to the virus' variable incubation period lengths.
    We implemented both a strict clock model of evolution and a per-generation model of evolution, representiing the 
    two extreme possibilities of how mutational events could be distributed within a host. We found that at low substitution rates, these 
    models behave functionally identically, as mutation is such a rare event that most within-host passages will not see
    and SNPs occur. However, a difference in behaviour was seen at substitution rates above 1 substitution per generation.
