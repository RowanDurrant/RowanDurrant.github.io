<h1>Hi! I'm Rowan</h1>
<p>I'm currently a final year PhD student at the University of Glasgow working on rabies evolution. This website is still under construction, 
    but you can visit the Research tab to learn more about my current work, the Background tab to 
learn more about my undergraduate and masters work, and the Publications tab for a list of the publications I've been involved in.</p>

<p>I am interested in using evolutionary models to explore how viruses evolve and to evaluate genomic surveillance, 
    and analysing virus genomic datasets.
